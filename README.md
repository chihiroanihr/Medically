# Medicly

What we have created?
ER registration application called “Medically”: both iOS and website
Purpose: to facilitate registration process (mostly to reduce waiting time, waiting line)

What does this do?
Collects an user information first
Collects a general information of patient’s pain (by clicking regions on given body image)
Additional information, such as ()
We send these information to qualified hospital employee
So that employee determines the priority order,based on the information sent from the patient, and sends back the waiting time

What we used?
HTML/CSS and Javascript for web site development
Used flasks to collect information from user interface to make it into a text file which is being sent to backend
Used python for backend calculation and database
Used flasks to return the informations to the user

What we need to improve? Challenges?
We were all front-end beginners so spent hard time figuring out how to code
It was difficult to collect information from user interface, we attempted to use django first to make a data file, turned out we had not enough time to finish it
Sending the request to the HTTP server was also hard

What we learned?
We improved our front-end skills, learned multiple programing languages such as HTML/CSS, Javascript, and swift
We practiced using various modules such as django and flasks
We learned how to establish an app

What’s next challenge?
Add an security component
Improve registration page on web
